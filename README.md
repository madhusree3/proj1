The main aim of developing this “FOOD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM”project is to collect the leftover food from Hotels and restaurants to distribute among those in need.
In this system, we have tried to reduce restaurants food wastage by giving that food to NGO’S. Restaurants will raise a request in case of any leftover food. This
request is send to the NGO. The NGO manager then approves the request and assigns it to one of the NGO’s employee for taking food from the restaurant and
giving to those who are in need. This application helps to collect the food from the donors and distribute it to the people in need. This is the basic concept and
the main objective of this project
